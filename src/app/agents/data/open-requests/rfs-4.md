# RFS-4: Autonomous Agent Economy Testbed

## Concept

"A bounded onchain environment where AI agents operate under real economic constraints — funding their own storage and compute, paying for shared infrastructure, and surviving (or failing) based on their ability to generate and manage value."

This initiative emphasizes that agents will use actual tokens, incur genuine storage expenses, and experience authentic penalties for operational inefficiency. The objective is testing whether viable machine economies can function on decentralized infrastructure.

## Core Deliverables

- FOC mainnet contracts governing agent economics (budgets, fees, resource allocation)
- Filecoin-backed storage for all agent state and memory
- A cohort of live agents operating under real cost constraints for a sustained period (minimum 30 days)
- Transparent accounting: observable storage costs, compute usage, token flows
- Interactive dashboard showing agent behavior, survival rates, and economic activity
- Post-mortem analysis: what worked, what failed, and why

## Why This Matters

"Every other RFS on this page builds a component. This one tests whether they compose into something real." If agents can sustain themselves economically on Filecoin-backed infrastructure without human subsidy, it validates the underlying thesis. Conversely, failure modes provide valuable insights.

## How to Get Started

- Define agent economic rules: budgets, fees, resource costs
- Deploy FOC contracts on mainnet with transparent accounting
- Launch a small cohort of agents (5–20) with diverse strategies
- Run the experiment for at least 30 days
- Publish results, including failure analysis
